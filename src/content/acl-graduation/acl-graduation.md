My career counselor was the first person to tell me that I should never call my code school a "Bootcamp," but she wasn't the last.  

"Call it 'Professional Training,' because that's what it is." She said. "If people hear 'Bootcamp,' you'll be dealing with immediate prejudice, and they'll miss what you bring to the table."

But I am really proud of my 'Bootcamp' experience.  Outside of the tech industry, a *Bootcamp* is respected for what it is: an intensive, challenging, mind and body training tool.  You enter Bootcamp as a chubby-cheeked, naive greenling, and leave a hard and powerful actor, fit for duty.  That's exactly what my tech Bootcamp did for me, except instead of leaving with a six pack, I gained 10 pounds and an amazing weath of knowledge about the language I studied (javaScript), TDD testing, fullstack architcecture, and how to hit the ground running on any team I walked into.

What I've learned since graduation is that the Tech Industry is in dire need of a wake-up call.  I graduated in July of this year, and already had and heard of many conversations with people in hiring positions stressed about finding good talent for their companies.  Everyone wants the "Unicorn," the rare Senior Dev who is up on every cutting-edge language and architecture, but conservative and experienced enough to stick to efficient and scalable practices to keep the ship running at a clip.

I want to work with that the person, too.  I've had the honor of learning from a couple now, and each experience has a stong hand in shaping my progression in the industry.  I have only met these legends because they do not agree with the hiring managers I just referred to, because they know the fastest way to find more "Unicorns," is to start training them, right now.

There's nothing wrong with the lucky ones among us to achieve a Computer Science degree.  I've witnessed a lot of debate about the merits of difference degree programs, if the deep foundational knowledge is crucial or a waste of time... Those conversations remind me of similar debates regarding all higher education at the moment.
