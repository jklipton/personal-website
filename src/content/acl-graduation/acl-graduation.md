My career counselor was the first person to tell me that I should never call my code school a "Bootcamp."  

"Call it 'Professional Training,' because that's what it is." She said. "If people hear 'Bootcamp,' you'll be dealing with immediate prejudice, and they'll miss what you bring to the table."

But I am really proud of my 'Bootcamp' experience.  Outside of the tech industry, a *Bootcamp* is respected for what it is: an intensive, challenging, mind and body training tool.  You enter Bootcamp as a chubby-cheeked, naive greenling, and leave a hard and powerful actor, fit for duty.  That's exactly what my tech Bootcamp did for me, except instead of leaving with a six pack, I gained 10 pounds and an amazing weath of knowledge about the language I studied (javaScript), TDD testing, fullstack architcecture, and how to hit the ground running on any team I walked into.

What I've learned since is that the Tech Industry is in dire need of a wake-up call.  I graduated in July of this year, and already had many conversations or conversations about conversatiions with people in hiring positions stressed about finding good talent for their companies.
